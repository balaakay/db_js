What can I do and what can I not do for RAM storage and Disk storage using JS?

Do I need to start with the storage system? The database/table/record creation
system? The SQL parser and query optimizer?
  I think starting with the storage system is going to be the biggest difficulty
  because of JS's inability to work directly with memory. If I can figure that out,
  then I can probably finish the project.
  * So node has a library called 'fs' that allows you to work with the filesystem
    and there is also a way to work with memory using arrayBuffers and node.js 
    buffers. So the storage system, although very difficult, is possible.

  If I do not start there, I would probably start with the DB object creation or
  the SQL parser. Most likely the SQL parser. I would like to learn how an AST
  works and get a working parser. Getting a working parser in JS would be kind of
  cool.
    The parser has 3 parts:
      the character input stream
      the token input stream (lexer)
      parser

    This is good information when handling the 3 different tasks of the 'parser'

  The query executor will have to be some sort of layer on top of the parser and
  the storage system so that the right API's are called when a database is created
  or when a row is selected.
